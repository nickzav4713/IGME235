# Artifact Thief

A stealth game with magic powers

</div>

<div id="contentRight">![Gameplay Image](images/stealthGameplay.jpg)</div>

In a world where magic has become a part of everyone's daily lives, you, a thief, have a desire to strive for greater power, which can come from ancient magical artifacts that help awaken one's inner abilities. You will go around collecting magic artifacts to strengthen yourself, and use your power for what you believe in. Will you follow a path of violence through the flames or stealth through the shadows?

## Story

In a world filled with magic, you, a thief, have awakened with powers of the arcane arts. Dissatisfied with your current powers, you begin to search for magic artifacts and plot to steal them. As you steal more and more magic artifacts, your power will grow, but will your ego grow too? Will you remain a thief, or drop even further below that?

<div class="pageContent">

## Gameplay

### Mechanics

Use magic ( learn more as level up or progress through game) to sneak around (silence footsteps, invisible for a couple seconds, blend into environment) and complete the given objective without getting caught by the enemy

### Controls

Keyboard/Mouse

### Teaching game to new user

Tutorial level showing what can be done and basics

### Player Learning

Learning different magic allows for unique approaches to levels, using different types of magic to pass the same obstacle, giving each player a personal experience, such as stealth based magic, which is going to be the main focus of the game initially, such as a blink ability, invisibility and camouflage and guide the player towards a peaceful playthrough. However, as the player unlocks more and more artifacts, more kinds of magic will be unlocked, giving more options, like magic that can allow the player to fight.

## Overall Process

I started off my work by creating the content that goes in the page. I focused most of my efforts initially on making the game treatment document, as that will populate one of my main pages. I then came up with a rough sketch for my webpage, figuring out where to place content on my page, so I knew what I was building my website towards. After this, I created the HTML document and marked up my content, and then used CSS to bring my website to life.
